## Technical Implementation Details

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure

#### 1.1 Note Interface Enhancement
**File**: `types/note.ts`
```typescript
export interface Note {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  content: string;
  createdAt: string;
  updatedAt: string;
  images: string[];
  audioRecordings: string[];

- deleteVideo(videoUri: string): Promise<void>
- getVideoInfo(videoUri: string)
- getAllVideos(): Promise<string[]>
- formatFileSize(sizeInBytes: number): string
- generateThumbnailPath(videoUri: string): string
```

### Phase 2: Video Recording Component

#### 2.1 VideoRecorder Component
**File**: `components/VideoRecorder.tsx`

**Dependencies Added**:
```bash
npx expo install expo-camera  # v15.0.16
```

**Key Features**:

- **Lưu ý**: Do sự cố công cụ, mã nguồn của `VideoRecorder.tsx` không thể được xác minh trực tiếp tại thời điểm cập nhật báo cáo này. Mô tả này dựa trên chức năng ban đầu và có thể không phản ánh 100% mã nguồn hiện tại.

**UI Components**:
- Camera view with overlay controls
- Recording indicator with timer
- Flip camera button
- Large record/stop button
- Permission request screens
- Error handling dialogs

### Phase 3: Video Playback Component (Upgraded to expo-video)

#### 3.1 VideoPlayer Component
**File**: `components/VideoPlayer.tsx`
**Library**: `expo-video`

**Key Features**:
- **Modern Hook-based Player**: Utilizes the `useVideoPlayer` hook for efficient state management.
- **Full Playback Controls**: Play/pause, seeking, volume control.
- **Robust Fullscreen Mode**:
    - Uses `enterFullscreen`/`exitFullscreen` methods.
    - **Reliable State Sync**: Relies on the `onFullscreenExit` prop to keep UI consistent with the native player state.
    - **StatusBar Management**: Automatically hides the system status bar in fullscreen.
- **Progress Bar**: Visual progress with time display.
- **Auto-hide Controls**: Automatic control hiding during playback.
- **Advanced Loading States**: Dedicated loading indicator with a timeout to prevent infinite spinners.
- **Superior Error Handling**: Listens for player status changes, displays a clear error message, and provides a "Try Again" button.
- **Haptic Feedback**: Uses `expo-haptics` for a better tactile experience on controls.
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to container size.

**Technical Implementation**:
- The component is built around the `useVideoPlayer` hook, which manages the video lifecycle.
- A `VideoView` component is used for rendering the video output.
- A `ref` to the `VideoView` component is used to call fullscreen methods (`enterFullscreen`/`exitFullscreen`).
- Multiple event listeners (`playingChange`, `mutedChange`, `statusChange`) are attached to the player instance to reactively update the component's state. The `onFullscreenExit` prop is used for handling fullscreen changes.

### Phase 4: UI Integration

**Interface Options**:
```typescript
interface MediaPickerProps {
  onImagePicked: (imageUri: string) => void;
  onVideoPicked?: (videoUri: string) => void;    // ✅ NEW
  showVideoOptions?: boolean;                    // ✅ NEW
}
```

## Architecture Decisions

### 1. Service Layer Pattern
**Decision**: Create dedicated `VideoService` following existing `AudioService` pattern
**Rationale**: Maintains consistent architecture and separation of concerns
**Benefits**: Reusable, testable, maintainable code structure

### 2. Component Composition & Hooks
**Decision**: Separate `VideoRecorder` and `VideoPlayer` components. **Upgraded `VideoPlayer` to use the `useVideoPlayer` hook from `expo-video`**.
**Rationale**: Single responsibility principle, better reusability, and improved performance and state management with the hook-based approach.
**Benefits**: Focused components, easier testing, flexible usage.

### 3. Storage Strategy
**Decision**: Use dedicated `videos/` directory with file copying pattern
**Rationale**: Consistent with existing image/audio storage approach
**Benefits**: Organized file structure, predictable file management

### 4. Permission Handling
**Decision**: Built-in permission requests with graceful fallbacks
**Rationale**: Better user experience, reduced friction
**Benefits**: Smooth onboarding, clear error messages

## User Experience Design

### 1. Recording Interface
- **Camera Preview**: Full-width preview with 4:3 aspect ratio
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear recording indicator with timer
- **Control Layout**: Intuitive bottom-center record button
- **Quality Feedback**: Recording status and duration display

### 2. Playback Interface  
- **Professional Controls**: Standard video player interface
- **Fullscreen Support**: Seamless fullscreen transitions
- **Progress Indication**: Clear progress bar with time
- **Auto-hide Behavior**: Non-intrusive control visibility

### 3. Integration Experience
- **Consistent Patterns**: Matches existing image/audio workflows
- **Unified Selection**: Single interface for all media types
- **Edit Mode**: Seamless video management during editing
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Clear section organization

## Performance Considerations
